# GPA Predictor

A **Streamlit web application** that predicts a student's **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** based on their internal assessment marks, with data scraped from the **SPECTRA portal**.

---

## Important Notice
This application is currently **not functional** due to recent changes on the SPECTRA website that introduced a **captcha**, which broke the web scraper.  

This tool was specifically designed for students of **KMIT** and has been observed to provide the **most accurate predictions for 2nd-year students (grey tags).**
